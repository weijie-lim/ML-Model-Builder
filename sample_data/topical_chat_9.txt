agent_1 : Naming a cloned cat "copy cat", that's cute. 
agent_2 : You must have ESP. I was going to tell you teh same thing! I have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in Asia than as pets in the US. 
agent_1 : Really? That's awful to hear! 
agent_2 : Of Roosevelt's 20 pets two were a bear and hyena! 
agent_1 : Whoa, cool! I know he seemed to be quite the animal lover. 
agent_2 : And there are more pets in Japan than there are children under 15. You can't be a pets "OWNER" in Boulder but you can be their guardian.   
agent_1 : I have a pet. I am an ailurophile meaning I love cats. 
agent_2 : Cool word! Did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on Earth? 
agent_1 : That is a lot! And in 2002 Germany gave them legal rights. 
agent_2 : Yeah, and the Loch Ness monster is protected under the 1912 Scottish Animal Protection Act. 
agent_1 : I wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting... being immortal and all. 
agent_2 : Lol...speaking of water animals, did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills? 
agent_1 : Maybe that connection is part of why 84% of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish, too... hmm. 
agent_2 : Hmm? Good theory. Seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals. 
agent_1 : Well, they are good at helping people adjust to new situations, too. 
agent_2 : Yes, like for elderly who are without companions. 
agent_1 : Or people with anxiety and depression, or kids with autism. 
agent_2 : Yes, a seahorse wouldn't be very good for that purpose. Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck? 
agent_1 : I don't think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length! 
agent_2 : That would freak me out! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication! 
agent_1 : Could be. Fish are cool like that. I think it's neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish. 
agent_2 : I wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish? 
agent_1 : That would be a good thing to know, especially because some of them make good pets. 
agent_2 : Yep, but I don't know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog 
agent_1 : Probably not. Dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time. 
agent_2 : Hey, did you know the first marine predator was the shark? They developed in the Silurian period. 
agent_1 : Very interesting. I wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then... 
agent_2 : Or have evolved into other species. The shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer. 
agent_1 : That makes sense. I always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone. 
agent_2 : Yes, fascinating fact! Tuna also hold a higher core temperature. They are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers. 
agent_1 : Tuna can get quite large, too. It's cool how big some fish get. 
agent_2 : One more before we go...did you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead? 
agent_1 : Yeah. that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild. 
agent_2 : Very cool chatting with you. Did you know there are 6331 groups of genes? They are common to all living animals! 
agent_1 : It was a cool exercise in zoology chatting with you.
