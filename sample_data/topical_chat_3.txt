agent_1 : Hi!  do you like to dance? 
agent_2 : I love to dance a lot. How about you? 
agent_1 : I am really bad, but it is a good time. 
agent_2 : Dancing is a lot of fun. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer? 
agent_1 : I heard that, winning Cha Cha championships and everything! 
agent_2 : Yes that is amazing. He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship back in 1958 in fact. 
agent_1 : I always just thought of him as a martial arts legend.  Now he is a dance legend of sorts too! 
agent_2 : Yeah!! That is correct. He was a fantastic martial artist. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school? 
agent_1 : Yeah!  He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.  Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him. 
agent_2 : Neither did I. That is insane because Tupac was a famous rapper.  
agent_1 : He was indeed, his music is even in the library of congress. 
agent_2 : I didn't know this thanks for sharing. 
agent_1 : Sure thing!  Did you hear about Michael Jackson's special patent shoes? 
agent_2 : No. I know that Michael Jackson was a fantastic dancer but can you tell me more about his patent shoes if you don't mind. 
agent_1 : There was a specific device in his shoes that helped with his extreme lean in some dance moves. 
agent_2 : Wow!!! That is amazing coming from such a talented singer and dancer. I couldn't even dance like that even if I dreamed of it. 
agent_1 : Me neither. I could never be a professional dancer. 
agent_2 : I heard that some professional ballet dancer can go through four pairs of shoes in a week. 
agent_1 : That is crazy!  That can't be cheap for them. 
agent_2 : No. I think its very expensive for them to be professional ballet dancers based on this. 
agent_1 : It has been great chatting but I must go!  Gotta go get my Bruce Lee on, the martial arts part...  definitely not the dance. 
agent_2 : Ha Ha!!! It was so nice chatting with you as well!! Have a nice day!!! Bye 
agent_1 : Bye
