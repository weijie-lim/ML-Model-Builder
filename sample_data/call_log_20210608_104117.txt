agent_1 : Can you believe there is stars that can be cold enough to be touched ? The universe is so diverse.  
agent_2 : Its amazing and ever evolving.  
agent_1 : Yeah and there is even places that exist but we never will be able to see because they are too far away.  
agent_2 : They are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see 
agent_1 : Yes that is what I was saying, albeit I doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say.  
agent_2 : I don't see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure.  
agent_1 : Yeah, but only one ? For all the universe ? It does not seems logic ... 
agent_2 : There is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron?  
agent_1 : Because an electron is part of matter, the water you drink, the chair you sit on. Saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread.   
agent_2 : It makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big. 
agent_1 : Maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe ? 
agent_2 : I don't know but I am at the end of knowledge on this subject. What do you think about the facts of comics? I would have thought US invented them, but it's Japan or UK. 
agent_1 : Japan has a great printing history, I am not surprised about this. Do you read comics books ? I have read a few but not about super-heroes.  
agent_2 : I used to in my childhood but not any more, I used to love inspector Gadget.  
agent_1 : Was Inspect Gadget a comics on Paper or a cartoon on TV ? I was talking about what Marvel is publishing. 
agent_2 : On Paper and yes I do recall seeing Super-hero and Hulk books. 
agent_1 : I think that Hulk is in the Marvel universe. But like I said, I never read anything from Marvel nor DC comics.  
agent_2 : Right me neither, there were so many good choices of comics when I was growing up.  
agent_1 : Not where I lived, if I want to read a comic book, I had to go to the library. But as I think about it Tintin is a comic book, so I was wrong, I did read a lot of them when I was young but they were European.   
agent_2 : Mine all time favorite was Bozo the clown, books and TV both.  
agent_1 : I did saw a lot of cartoons on TV, but I don't think that considered as a comic book. have a nice day.
