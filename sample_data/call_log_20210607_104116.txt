agent_1 : Do you like comic books? 
agent_2 : I do like comic books! 
agent_1 : Have you heard that Harley Quinn has a new comic book series coming out? 
agent_2 : I have not heard that.  I know that comic book legend Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation with "excelsior!" 
agent_1 : I've heard that too. Did you know that the DC in DC comics stands for Detective Comics? 
agent_2 : I just read that today.  The largest comic book market is in Japan.  I believe it.  My son loves to read those mangas. 
agent_1 : I would love to go there. I used to like reading Manga too.  
agent_2 : The manga market is Japan is valued at $6 to $7 billion dollars! 
agent_1 : That is wild! Did you know that Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world? 
agent_2 : I didn't know that.  I wonder how many people use it.  By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion! 
agent_1 : That's crazy, Japan is way more into comic books than America it seems.  
agent_2 : I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616! 
agent_1 : That's pretty wild. Marvel published a "generic comic book," in order to trademark the names "superhero" and "super-villain." That was pretty smart of them.  
agent_2 : No doubt!  Do you know much about the planets or the universe? 
agent_1 : I know a little bit. I've heard that Venus does not tilt.  
agent_2 : That interesting.  Uranus is different to.  It actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets. 
agent_1 : That's really interesting. I've also heard that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.  
agent_2 : It must be pretty big then!  I wouldn't want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph! 
agent_1 : I don't see that being a pleasant place. It's even 2000 degree weather. That sounds like hell to me! 
agent_2 : Hahah That's a good way of putting it!  
agent_1 : Well I have to get to work, I hope you have a good day. It was nice chatting with you!
